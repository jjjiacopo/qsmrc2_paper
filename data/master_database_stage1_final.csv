All networks were trained using an L1 loss function, with ADAMW used for optimization with step size and weight decay parameters of 3e-4 and 1e-5 respectively. 179 high-resolution 3D images were used for training and 40 images for testing [3]. Initial susceptibility maps were computed using an LSMR solver using either 1) 5 iterations early exiting when computed without magnitude 2) 1e-3 stopping tolerance and mean of magnitude as damping parameter when using magnitude. Susceptibility maps were computed for each echo as well as the frequency map. The final result was the mean of these maps.","[1] Kobler E, Klatzer T, Hammernik K, Pock T.
